Here the scientific computing is, as to my very limited knowledge, related mainly to my own interests and experiences in plant phenotyping and remote sensing. People now talk deep learning everywhere. The best machine learning library for deep learning might be the ‘TensorFlow’ which is developed by Google (years ago I knew nothing about python but heard that python was heavily used by Google). Python is known as an open-source high-level programming (scripting) language that is easy to read and understand. The greatest thing is that it can glues other programming languages for doing multi-tasks in one environment, e.g,. the famous Python-OpenCV library, based on which the ‘PlantCV’ is developed https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv. 

The learning curve might be deep, but it will boost your efficiency and creativity and extend your skills far beyond, as well as bring added value for future career development.

## Some Free IDEs:
Data scientists are extremely active in python development. For scientific programming there are several Python IDE similar to Matlab and RStudio, for instance the: 

- **[Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)** is a Rstudio-like IDE.
- **[Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/)** and **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)** will simplify the package management.
- **[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)**, a modern web-based interface, typing in bash ‘jupyter notebook’ will open your browser for live scripting, this is so cool!!

There is also a MinGW for running linux’s bash in Windows. http://www.mingw.org/ , as well as other various options that Google won’t refuse to help you find out!

## Some great websites for learning scientific python: 
[Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) is a great source of learning materials and examples.
