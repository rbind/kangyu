.., my old website has been dead since >2 years. I have now finaaaaaaaaaaaly migrated to [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), a great r package developed by [Yihui](http://yihui.name), based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). This site is currently deployed on Netlify - blogdown simply makes a website a folder of static files, and can be put on any web [server](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html).
